Busel Hısım , Mert İşeri, Meltem Özleşen Home Automation Project
What we will be automating: In our home automation system, we will be automating
-air conditioning
-checking whether windows and doors are open
-lights of the house 
-Home heating system
-Home appliances control
What we need to do is to prepare a detailed home automation system for remote control and automation of a home. We will describe each system we want to bulid in Verilog hardware description language as separate blocks, by using logic gates, block diagrams when necessary, by first writing truth tables for each step of the home automation system we plan, by using multiplexers, and by using the methods of simplifying logical expressions for complex truth tables. When we integrate these blocks together at the necessary points, we will have a large and single top module. After writing the testbench of the top module and checking whether it works correctly,we will perform synthesis and implementation.

ABOUT OUR VERILOG DESCRIPTION:
In our home automation system's verilog description this is how we take inputs and outputs:
In our door locking system and window system we will put switches to our inputs such as windows and doors and our outputs will be connected to electrical motors which will be working mechanically. 
In our heating system verilog description, our inputs about rooms' temperatures will be connected to thermometer. Our output will be connected to our heater. 
In our appliences system inputs will be entered manually. 
In our light system our switches will be connected to the switch of lights in every room.
